# Gesture Controlled Project

This Python script implements a gesture-controlled system using the MediaPipe library for hand tracking. The script tracks hand movements in real-time and draws landmarks on the detected hand.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```
## Project Structure

- `hand_tracker.py`: Python script for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
